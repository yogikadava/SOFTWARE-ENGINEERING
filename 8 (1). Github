Demonstrate how to work collaboratively in Git/GitHub on a project using the fork-and-pull request workflow.
Tasks:
1. Fork an existing public GitHub repository (e.g., a sample JavaScript or Python project).
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Create a new branch for the feature or change you want to work on.
4. Make modifications or add new features (e.g., add a function, fix a bug, or update the README).
5. Commit your changes and push the branch to GitHub.
6. Go to the GitHub repository and create a pull request to merge your feature branch into the main branch.
7. Review the pull request and provide feedback on the changes.
8. Respond to feedback by making additional commits to the feature branch if necessary.
9. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the main branch.
10. Finally submit the link to the pull request along with a summary of the changes you made and how you 
collaborated.
